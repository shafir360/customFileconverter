docx_generator.py

This module contains business logic for creating a nicely formatted Word document
from a structured JSON object. The JSON object must follow the structure:

{
  "title": "Your Document Title",
  "sections": [
    {
      "type": "heading" | "subheading" | "paragraph" | "bullet" |
              "numbered" | "quote" | "highlight" | "bold" | "table" |
              "image" | "summary" | "questions" | "resources",
      "content": "The text content or an array of strings (for lists) or a nested array (for tables)"
    },
    ...
  ]
}

This module includes:
  - A helper function for parsing simple markdown syntax for **bold** and __highlighted__
    text.
  - A main function `build_word_document` that creates the document.
  - A function `generate_image_from_prompt` that calls an n8n webhook to generate an image.
